## Description
This mod aims to enhance the vanilla redstone experience in a vanilla fitting style by adding some useful components and easing the construction process of your redstone contraptions

As for now, it includes a 'redstone debugger overlay' and 14 blocks in a way that fits the mood and feel of Vanilla Minecraft, also preserving the "circuit" style redstoning, no automatic block-machines that do everything in a cheap-ish way

### <p align="center">BETA</p>
The content included is stable and tested, however, the mod is still on beta stage and it will only be available for Fabric ModLoader during this stage (probably), please [send feedback](https://github.com/Sopze92/minecraft-mod-redstonepp/issues) if you experience any crash or bug caused by this mod

More Features are already planned for the future, including server support, fully directional redstone (which includes vertical axis), and item transport + filtering systems that also fits vanilla (which no mod has done yet)
